# Dev setup
This probably only works on Ubuntu, and I haven't quite properly tested it much, so use it with a grain of salt
and give the scripts a good read before running them. There will probably be bugs. You've been warned. :)
The config files themselves have been pretty neat to use, though, you should probably walk through the setup of 
each tool individually.

## How to use
`git clone` this repository somewhere. URL in the green button up above.

`cd` where you cloned this repository

Run the zsh setup file
`./setup-zsh.sh`

Run the tmux setup file
`./setup-tmux.sh`

Run the Neovim setup file
`setup-tmux.sh`


You should probably run this as soon as you install Ubuntu Server in your VM or wherever you install it.
